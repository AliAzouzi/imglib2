 * source domain that can be sampled for values from a target domain T.
 * <em>Note</em> that {@link Sampler Samplers} returned by the {@link Function}
 * interface alone cannot be addressed in the unspecified source domain and
 * thus cannot do anything but access a default T.  That is, any implementation
 * of {@link Function} has to implement another interface that specifies the
 * source domain over which a T is defined.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Image processing usually refers to {@link Function Functions} over real
 * (f:R<sup>n</sup>&rarr;T) or discrete (f:Z<sup>n</sup>&rarr;T) space with the
 * latter being a subset of the former.  The source domain may be constrained
 * further as an interval over such space.  The standard interfaces for image
 * processing are thus:</p>
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt>{@link PositionableFunction}</dt>
 * <dd>random access at real coordinates</dd>
 * <dt>{@link PositionableInterval}</dt>
 * <dd>random access at real coordinates with an {@link OutOfBoundsStrategy}
 * that generates values beyond the boundaries of the source domain</dd>
 * <dt>{@link IterableFunction}</dt>
 * <dd>access to all T in the target domain and their coordinates in the
 * source domain via {@link Iterator}</dd>
 * <dt>{@link Raster}</dt>
 * <dd>random access at integer coordinates</dd>
 * <dt>{@link RasterInterval}</dt>
 * <dd>random access at integer coordinates with an {@link OutOfBoundsStrategy}
