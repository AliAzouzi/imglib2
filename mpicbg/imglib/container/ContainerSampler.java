 * does not necessarily reflect any meaningful analogy in some physical space.
 * For {@link Container Containers} that store actual sample values for each
 * pixel, this interface provides access to these pixel samples

 * {@link ContainerSampler} is the common basic interface to access pixel data in
 * any {@link Container}.  Other {@link Sampler Samplers} build on top of it.
