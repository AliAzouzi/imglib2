	 * which basic type is used (float, int, byte, ...) but does not know how it
	 * is stored ({@link Array}, {@link CellDirectAccessContainer}, ...) to

	 * also an {@link Array}, {@link CellDirectAccessContainer}, ... which can
	 * then communicate with the {@link ArrayCursor},
	 * {@link CellBasicRasterIterator}, ... and return the current basic type
	 * array.
	 * 
	 * A typical implementation of this method looks like that (this is the
	 * {@link FloatType} implementation):
	 * 
	 * float[] v = floatStorage.getCurrentStorageArray( c );
	 * 
	 * @param c
	 *            - the {@link ImgCursor} gives a link to itself so that

	 *            basic type array.
