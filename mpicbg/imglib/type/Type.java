/**
 * The {@link Type} class is responsible for computing. It can be instaniated as
 * a variable holding one single value only or with a DirectAccessContainer.
 * There is no differentiation between the two cases except for the constructor
 * to avoid double implementations.
 * 
 * The {@link Type} is the only class that is aware of the actual data type,
 * i.e. which basic type ({@link DataAccess}) is used to store the data. On the
 * other hand it does not know the storage type ({@link Array},
 * {@link ImgCursor}, ...). This is not necessary for computation and avoid
 * complicated re-implementations. The method public void updateDataArray(
 * Cursor<?> c ); links the DirectAccessContainer and the cursor which define
 * the current position as well as the current storage array.
