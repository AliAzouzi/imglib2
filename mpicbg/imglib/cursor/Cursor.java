/**
 * The {@link Cursor} is responsible for iterating over the image. Therefore it has to be implemented 
 * for each type of {@link Container} like {@link Array}, {@link Cube}, ... 
 * 
 * The {@link Cursor} does not know which {@link Type} of {@link Image} it is working on as there this
 * is not important for its positioning. It is typed to the {@link Type} so that the {@link Cursor} is
 * able to return the correct instance of {@link Type} when calling the getType() method.
 * 
 * The {@link Cursor} class itself is only capable of iterating over all pixels of the {@link Image}, 
 * there is no guaranteed order in which the pixels are iterated, this depends on the implementation for
 * the specific {@link Container}.
