/**
 * <h2>The {@link RasterIterator} interface</h2>
 * 
 * <h3>Implementation</h3>
 * 
 * {@link RasterIterator RasterIterators} are used to iterate over a raster of
 * pixels.  They depend on the way how pixels are stored and thus need to be
 * implemented for each {@link Container} like {@link Array}, {@link CellContainer}, ... 
 * 
 * <h3>Data access</h3>
 * 
 * {@link RasterIterator RasterIterator} do not know about the {@link Image}
 * {@link Type} as it is not important for iteration.  However, {@link Type} is
 * a generic parameter such that the correct instance of {@link Type} is
 * returned by {@link #get()}.
 * 
 * <h3>Traversal policy</h3>
 * 
 * There is no particular guaranty regarding the order of iteration other than
 * that all pixels are visited once before {@link #hasNext()} returns true.
 * The actual order of iteration depends on the {@link Container} and is
 * expected to be optimal in terms of access performance.
 * <p>
 * However, it is <em>guaranteed</em> that for two same
 * {@link Container Containers} with equal dimensions and properties, the 
 * traverse path will be the same.  For instance, if the following is true:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
  		Container&lt T &gt c1 = img1.getContainer(); 
  		Container&lt S &gt c2 = img2.getContainer();
 		if ( c1.compareStorageContainerCompatibility( c2 ) )  
 * </pre>
 * then, it is ensured that
 * <pre>
 * 		{
 * 			RasterIterator&lt T &gt cursor1 = img1.createBasicIterator();
 * 			RasterIterator&lt S &gt cursor2 = img2.createBasicIterator();
 * 			while ( cursor1.hasNext() )
			{
				cursor1.fwd();
				cursor2.fwd();
			}
		}
 * </pre>
 * will visit the <em>same pixel positions</em>.
 * <p>
 * If the two {@link Container Containers} are not the same, then
 * {@link IntegerLocalizable} and {@link PositionableRasterIntervalSampler} have to be
 * used:
 * <pre>
 * 		else {
 * 			LocalizableCursor&lt T &gt cursor1 = img1.createLocalizableCursor();
 * 			LocalizableByDimCursor&lt S &gt cursor2 = img2.createLocalizableByDimCursor();
 * 			while ( cursor1.hasNext() )
 * 			{
 * 				cursor1.fwd();
 * 				cursor2.moveTo( cursor1 );
 * 			}
 * 		}
 * </pre>
 * This snippet will also traverse images the same way, but this is less efficient than the previous solution 
 * with identical containers.
 *<p>
 * This interface is for convenience only, it combines a set of interfaces and
 * might be used for type definition in your implementation.  Instead of this
 * interface, you can use a generic type that includes only the interfaces you
 * need, e.g.
 * 
 * < T extends RasterSampler< ? >, Iterator< ? > > 
 * 
 * @author Stephan Preibisch & Stephan Saalfeld
 *
 * @param <T> - the {@link Type} this {@link RasterIterator} works on
