// TODO - this is a simple implementation. It only works from a fixed point
// along an outer axis. Ideally in the future we'd have different shaped
// functions that would have regions within their domains stitched together.

// NOTE you cannot change dimensionality of functions. i.e. this might be
// a 3d function made up of other 3d functions. No stacks of 2d functions
// making a 3d function. Fix? Or make a stacked implementation too.

// Limitation : requires long[]'s. what about double[]'s?
