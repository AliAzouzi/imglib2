/**
 * A CachingFunction returns a cached value when the same input data is passed
 * to the evaluate() method. Currently it caches the last value only. Imagine 
 * you have a ConditionalFunction that evaluates a function twice (once as part
 * of the condition test and once as part of the assignment of value). This
 * class can be used to improve the performance of function evaluation if the
 * cost of computing the function is high. (The test for input equality is
 * relatively expensive in its own right)
