// In old AssignOperation could do many things

//     Now this can be done by creating a complex Condition
// - set regions of input and output
//     Now this can be done by creating a complex Condition
// - interrupt from another thread
//     still to do
// - observe the iteration
//     still to do
// regions in same image could be handled by a translation function that
//   transforms from one space to another
// regions in different images can also be handled this way
//   a translation function takes a function and a coord transform
// now also these regions, if shape compatible, can be composed into a N+1
//   dimensional space and handled as one dataset
