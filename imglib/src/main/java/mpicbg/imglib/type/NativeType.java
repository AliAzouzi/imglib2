 * A {@link NativeType} is a {@link Type} that that provides access to data
 * stored in native arrays, where the data may be split into chunks across
 * multiple arrays. To this end, implementations maintain a reference to the
 * current array (a {@link DataAccess}) and the index of an element in the
 * current array.
 * 
 * The {@link NativeType} is positioned on the correct data array and index by
 * accessors (e.g., {@link Cursor Cursors}, {@link RandomAccess RandomAccesses},
 * etc.)
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link NativeType} is the only class that is aware of the actual data type,
 * i.e., which basic type ({@link DataAccess}) is used to store the data. On the
 * other hand it does not know the storage layout, i.e., whether and how
 * the data is split into multiple chunks. This is determined by the container
 * (e.g., {@link Array}, {@link CellContainer}, etc.).
 * Separating the storage layout from access and operations on the {@link Type}
 * avoids re-implementation for each container type.

	 * This method is used by an accessor (e.g., a {@link Cursor})
	 * to request an update of the current data array.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * As an example consider a {@link CellCursor} moving on a {@link CellContainer}.
	 * The cursor maintains a {@link NativeType} which provides access to the image data.
	 * When the cursor moves from one cell to the next, the underlying data array
	 * of the {@link NativeType} must be switched to the data array of the new cell.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * To achieve this, the {@link CellCursor} calls {@link updateContainer()} with
	 * itself as the argument. {@link updateContainer()} in turn will call {@link update()}
	 * on it's container, passing along the reference to the cursor.
	 * In this example, the container would be a {@link CellContainer}.
	 * While the {@link NativeType} does not know about the type of the cursor,
	 * the container does.
	 * {@link CellContainer} knows that it is passed a {@link CellCursor} instance,
	 * which can be used to figure out the current cell and the underlying data array,
	 * which is then returned to the {@link NativeType}.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The idea behind this concept is maybe not obvious. The {@link NativeType} knows
	 * which basic type is used (float, int, byte, ...). However, it does not know how
	 * the data is stored ({@link Array}, {@link CellContainer}, ...).
	 * This prevents the need for multiple implementations of {@link NativeType}.
